# Build a Porfolio Site
--------

This repo serves as a home for the 'Build a Portfolio Site' project in the Udacity [Frontend Web Development](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) Nanodegree. This project was based on a set of requirements from a mockup, and a few custom elements added as a site logo for a little flourish. This portfolio theme uses CSS Flexbox for a simple layout structure, and media queries and breaking points for a responsive design.
